âœ… Here's what could be causing the 404 error â€” and how to fix it:
ðŸ§© Most Likely Cause:
easyJet uses dynamic session-based URLs or bot protection, and you're scraping a temporary link that's not valid outside that session.

Many airline websites (like easyJet) generate URLs that expire quickly or are tied to session cookies, JavaScript rendering, or user agents. When you copy those links and try to open them in your browser or app later, they return a 404.

âœ… Step-by-Step Fixes:
1. Avoid using session-based URLs
Ensure you're not copying direct links to booking pages, which expire.

Try to scrape static search result URLs (if any), or better: store flight data (price, date, airline, etc.) and redirect users to easyJetâ€™s main search page with parameters.

2. Redirect user to a valid base search page
Instead of showing a broken link, generate a URL like:

Copy
Edit
https://www.easyjet.com/en
Or attempt to construct a valid query-based URL like:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://www.easyjet.com/en/book/search?origin=LHR&destination=AMS&departureDate=2025-07-18
(You'll have to reverse-engineer the parameters if they exist; inspect network requests from the browser's DevTools when you use easyJet manually.)

3. Mimic browser behavior using Playwright or Puppeteer
If easyJet loads its content via JavaScript, you must use Playwright or Puppeteer to render the page and extract prices, because static HTTP requests or requests from microservices will miss dynamic content.

You're already using Playwright:

Edit
âœ… Playwright available for dynamic scraping
So ensure your scraper is:

Waiting for full page load (await page.waitForSelector(...))

Mimicking a real user (use realistic user agent)

Extracting data from rendered HTML, not from temporary redirect links

4. Double-check scraped links
From your logs:

sql
Copy
Edit
âœ… REAL DEAL: Amsterdam at Â£63 from easyJet
Make sure youâ€™re not storing links like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://book.easyjet.com/xyz-sessiontoken123
Instead:

Either remove the link altogether

Or link to https://www.easyjet.com/en with a flight search UI so the user can search manually
