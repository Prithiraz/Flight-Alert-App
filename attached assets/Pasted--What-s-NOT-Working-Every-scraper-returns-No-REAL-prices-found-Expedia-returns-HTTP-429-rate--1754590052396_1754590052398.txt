 What’s NOT Working:
Every scraper returns "No REAL prices found".

Expedia returns HTTP 429 → rate-limited

Cheapflights returns 404 → endpoint likely changed

All other HTML scrapers are getting valid HTML (large character sizes), but your parsers are failing to extract price data.

🎯 What This Means
Your scraper is not broken — it’s just outdated or too strict in parsing logic. Likely reasons:

HTML structure of Skyscanner, Kayak, etc. has changed

You’re getting ~160,000 characters — that means content is there

But your regex / XPath / BeautifulSoup parsing isn't matching price elements anymore

Anti-bot detection alters the HTML

You might be getting dummy versions of the page, despite the size

Check for phrases like “enable JavaScript” or “access denied”

Your scraper might be looking for hardcoded patterns that no longer exist

e.g. class="price" might now be class="fare-price"

✅ How to Fix It (Minimal Action Plan)
🛠 Step 1: Log and Inspect Raw HTML from Each Source
Add this to each source scraper (temporary debugging):

python
Copy code
with open(f"debug_{source}.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(response.text or page.content())
Then open the files (like debug_skyscanner.html) and inspect them manually in the browser or VS Code. Look for the actual price elements.

🧠 Step 2: Update Your Extractors
Once you know the real structure, update the logic. For example:

python
Copy code
# Instead of this:
price = soup.find("span", class_="price").text

# You may need this:
price = soup.select_one("div.fare .amount").text.strip()
Or if using regex, adapt to the new structure. Use:

python
Copy code
re.findall(r"£\d{2,4}", page_content)
🚫 Step 3: Skip Expedia or Rate-Limited Sources
Since Expedia is returning 429 Too Many Requests, avoid querying it for now to reduce noise.

✅ Step 4: Re-test with a Clean Target
Try with a known, high-frequency route like:

plaintext
Copy code
LHR → DUB
LGW → AMS
STN → FRA
These are short-haul, high-traffic routes more likely to return prices.

🔐 Pro Tip
If you want truly robust scrapers long-term:

Switch to Playwright page evaluation with selectors

Use headless browser waits for elements like:

python
Copy code
await page.wait_for_selector(".price")
