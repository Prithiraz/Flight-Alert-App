Alright — I’ve read your main.py and combined it with the console output you posted.
I’m going to give you exactly what you asked for: a world-class, highly detailed breakdown of

Why you’re not seeing any results for you or other users,

How you can be 100% sure that other users never touch the airline/OTA sites,

Why “Price War Tracker” and “Feeling Adventurous” aren’t showing up,

What needs improving in your system — with precise, implementable fixes.

I’ll go deep — so this is going to be long, but you’ll leave with a clear roadmap.

1️⃣ Why you and others aren’t seeing any flight data
Your server logs are telling the full story:

You see a burst of GET /api/results/4 requests every second or two after creating a query.

There are zero POST /api/ingest entries in the logs.

In your architecture:

GET /api/results/{id} → UI asking the backend “Do you have results for this query?”

POST /api/ingest → Extension sending real flight data to backend after parsing pages.

Since you’re never seeing POST /api/ingest, your backend is never being fed data, so GET /api/results just returns an empty list.

🔍 Root causes for POST /api/ingest never appearing
There are only four possible reasons in a BYOB setup:

Extension is not installed / not active in the browser session where you load the airline/metasearch pages.

Extension is pointing to the wrong backend URL

If the extension has http://0.0.0.0:5000 or http://localhost:5000 as BACKEND_BASE_URL — that works only if the backend is running on the same machine as the browser.

In Codespaces, 0.0.0.0 is internal — your Chrome on your Chromebook can’t reach it. You must use your Codespaces HTTPS preview URL.

CORS/permissions are blocking fetch from extension to backend.

allow_origins=["*"] in FastAPI is necessary for dev.

Extension’s manifest.json needs "host_permissions": ["<your preview URL>/*"].

Extension never gets the query_id for the search.

Without this, the extension refuses to send payloads because it doesn’t know which query to attach to.

You either set it manually in the extension options or broadcast from the search page via window.postMessage.

✅ Fix sequence (in order)
Confirm extension is installed and active

Go to chrome://extensions → ensure your BYOB extension is on and has permissions for your airline/meta sites.

Open airline page → check extension service worker console for logs like “BYOB: sent X itineraries”.

Update backend URL in extension settings

Use https://<your-github-username>-<codespace-id>.githubpreview.dev as BACKEND_BASE_URL.

No localhost, no 0.0.0.0.

Enable full CORS in main.py

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"]
)
Make query_id automatic

On your search page, after creating a query, run:

window.postMessage({ type: "FA_QUERY_CREATED", queryId: <id> }, "*");
In content.js of extension:

window.addEventListener("message", async (ev) => {
  if (ev.data?.type === "FA_QUERY_CREATED") {
    await chrome.storage.sync.set({ QUERY_ID: ev.data.queryId });
  }
});
Test ingestion pipeline without extension

curl -X POST https://<preview-url>/api/debug/ingest_example/4
If /api/results/4 suddenly shows a fake itinerary in the UI → UI and DB are fine, extension → backend is the missing link.

2️⃣ How to guarantee other users never touch airline sites
You can do this — but you must run it in true operator mode:

Only your browser + extension open the flight sites.

Other users just use the dashboard to set alerts.

Backend stores those alerts in a DB.

Your Operator Console fetches alerts → generates a list of target URLs → you open them one by one (or let tabs auto-rotate).

Your extension parses and sends to backend.

Backend matches itineraries to alerts and notifies users.

How you prove to yourself this works:

In your backend logs, IPs for /api/ingest will always be your own (from your extension’s fetch).

There will never be direct user IPs hitting airline domains — because they never visit them.

To users, it will look like you are “scraping for them” because results arrive in their dashboard despite them never leaving your app.

3️⃣ Why Price War Tracker & Feeling Adventurous are missing
I checked main.py — your routes/templates are missing the frontend components for these after login.

Here’s the likely reason:

You have a placeholder for the dashboard after login — showing only search + results.

“Price War Tracker” and “Feeling Adventurous” were never implemented in the dashboard template (dashboard.html) or in the backend routes (/alerts, /pricewar, /adventurous).

The code paths for those features exist only in planning, not in main.py or templates.

This is not user-specific — nobody sees them because they don’t exist yet in the rendered dashboard.

How to implement them (brief blueprint)
DB tables: alerts and price_history

Routes:

/alerts (CRUD for all alert types)

/alerts/match (called by ingest pipeline to check if a new itinerary matches)

UI: After login, show an Alerts tab with forms:

Cheap Alert: price ceiling, route, dates, baggage, cabin.

Rare Aircraft: aircraft list, route/date.

Feeling Adventurous: origin only, budget, flexible dates.

Price War: route, threshold drop vs median.

Match logic: When /api/ingest gets a new itinerary → run matching for active alerts → store matches and notify user.

4️⃣ Improvements & fixes (world-class quality plan)
Here’s a full improvement map for your situation:

Backend ingestion reliability
Token-protected ingest (x-fa-token) so random people can’t spam your DB.

Deduplication key: (carrier+number, depart_iso, origin, destination, price, currency) so you only store cheapest unique itineraries.

Provider URL fallback: always give a reconstructable URL (Skyscanner/Kayak/BA/etc.) in addition to deep link — solves “bad link” issue.

Link validator (Playwright HEAD check) → mark broken links and fallback to provider URL.

Operator-only mode
Build /operator-console route that:

Lists all active alerts from DB.

Generates a rotating list of URLs to open.

Lets you quickly click/rotate through sites.

Only run extension in the browser where you open these pages.

Frontend/Dashboard
Redesign dashboard after login:

Tabs: Search, Alerts, Matches.

Alerts tab contains Cheap, Rare, Adventurous, Price War forms.

Matches tab shows itineraries that triggered alerts (sortable, filterable).

Live updates via SSE instead of polling.

User perception of “scraping for them”
Show “collected X minutes ago” timestamps.

Show “Source: Skyscanner / BA / Kayak” with logos.

Ensure results update without them visiting flight sites — psychologically reinforces that you’re doing the work.

Monitoring
Add /api/stats route → number of active alerts, recent ingests, matches per user.

Add server-side logging for each alert match.

🔑 The non-negotiables to fix right now
Fix extension → backend connection (URL, CORS, query_id broadcast).

Add ingest debug test and verify UI updates.

Implement Operator-only URL rotation so only you visit sites.

Add provider URL fallback for broken deep links.

Implement Alerts + Matching so Price War / Adventurous actually exist post-login.
