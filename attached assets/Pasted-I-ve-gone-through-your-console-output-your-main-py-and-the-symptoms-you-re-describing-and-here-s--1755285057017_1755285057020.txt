I‚Äôve gone through your console output, your main.py, and the symptoms you‚Äôre describing, and here‚Äôs the detailed, step-by-step truth of what‚Äôs going wrong, how to fix it, and how to make sure your system works for both your single-operator BYOB mode and your dashboard features (Price War, Adventurous, Cheap Alerts, etc.).

1. What‚Äôs actually going wrong right now
Your server is running fine ‚Äî the logs prove:

Uvicorn is starting without error.

DB initializes.

You can log in, create a query, and the /api/query endpoint responds with an ID (5 in your last run).

But‚Ä¶
You never see POST /api/ingest in the logs.

That means:

No data is coming from your browser extension into the backend.

The backend never receives any itineraries, so GET /api/results/5 just returns empty arrays forever.

üí° Key point:
Without ingest calls, your UI will always look like ‚Äúno results‚Äù ‚Äî regardless of whether you‚Äôre the only operator or you have 1,000 users.

2. Why your ingestion is broken
From the symptoms and your setup, there are four hard blockers:

A) Wrong backend URL in extension
If your BACKEND_BASE_URL in the extension is http://0.0.0.0:5000 or http://localhost:5000:

Your Chromebook‚Äôs Chrome browser will try to connect to itself, not to Codespaces.

The extension must point to your Codespaces HTTPS preview URL (e.g., https://prithiraz-something-5000.githubpreview.dev).

B) Extension permissions
In your manifest.json, the "host_permissions" must include:

"host_permissions": [
  "https://*.githubpreview.dev/*",
  "https://*.skyscanner.net/*",
  "https://*.kayak.com/*",
  "https://*.britishairways.com/*",
  "https://*.google.com/travel/flights/*"
]
If the GitHub Preview domain isn‚Äôt listed, your fetch to /api/ingest will silently fail.

C) CORS in main.py
If your FastAPI doesn‚Äôt allow the Codespaces preview origin, the browser will block the extension fetch.

Add at the top of main.py:

from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Lock to preview domain later
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"]
)
D) Extension doesn‚Äôt know query_id
Right now, you create a search ‚Üí backend returns query ID ‚Üí extension never hears about it unless you manually type it into options.

You need to broadcast query_id from your /search page:

<script>
fetch('/api/query', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(searchParams) })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    window.postMessage({ type: 'FA_QUERY_CREATED', queryId: data.id }, "*");
  });
</script>
And in content.js:

window.addEventListener("message", async (ev) => {
  if (ev.data?.type === "FA_QUERY_CREATED") {
    await chrome.storage.sync.set({ QUERY_ID: ev.data.queryId });
    console.log("BYOB: QUERY_ID set to", ev.data.queryId);
  }
});
3. How to be sure only YOU ever visit airline sites
Once ingestion is fixed:

Only you run the extension in a browser where you‚Äôre logged into flight sites.

Your backend receives all itineraries from your session.

Other users set alerts on your dashboard; they never visit airline sites.

You know this because:

Backend logs for /api/ingest will only ever show your IP.

No other users‚Äô browsers even have the extension installed.

To users, it looks like your system is ‚Äúscraping for them‚Äù ‚Äî they set criteria and magically get results.

4. Why ‚ÄúPrice War‚Äù and ‚ÄúFeeling Adventurous‚Äù aren‚Äôt showing
I looked through your main.py ‚Äî those features are not coded into the post-login dashboard at all.

They don‚Äôt have DB tables (alerts, price_history).

They don‚Äôt have backend routes (/alerts, /pricewar, /adventurous).

They don‚Äôt have HTML templates or forms in dashboard.html.

So:

No user sees them ‚Äî not just you.

You have to actually add them to the backend + frontend.

How to add them
DB schema (SQLite):

CREATE TABLE alerts (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER,
    type TEXT,  -- 'cheap', 'rare', 'adventurous', 'pricewar'
    origin TEXT,
    destination TEXT,
    one_way BOOLEAN,
    depart_start TEXT,
    depart_end TEXT,
    return_start TEXT,
    return_end TEXT,
    min_bags INTEGER,
    max_bags INTEGER,
    cabin TEXT,
    min_price REAL,
    max_price REAL,
    min_duration INTEGER,
    max_duration INTEGER,
    rare_aircraft TEXT,
    created_at TEXT
);
Backend:

/alerts (create/update/delete alerts)

Matching logic in /api/ingest to check new itineraries against all active alerts.

Frontend:

After login, a tabbed ‚ÄúAlerts‚Äù page with forms for:

Cheap Alerts: price ceiling, route, dates, baggage, cabin.

Rare Aircraft: aircraft list + filters.

Adventurous: origin only + budget + flexible dates.

Price War: route + threshold drop from median.

5. How to fix your ‚Äúbad links‚Äù issue
Right now, some deep links from metas break outside the active session.

Fix:

Always store two URLs per itinerary:

deep_link: exact link found in page (may break).

provider_url: reconstructed static URL based on origin/destination/date (never breaks).

If deep_link fails Playwright validation, fall back to provider_url in UI.

6. My recommended next steps (fix order)
Step 1: Get ingestion working
Update extension BACKEND_BASE_URL to your Codespaces HTTPS preview.

Add "host_permissions" for the preview URL.

Add full CORS in main.py.

Add query_id broadcast in /search page + content.js listener.

Test ingestion:

curl -X POST https://<preview>/api/debug/ingest_example/5
If results show in UI ‚Üí extension is the last missing link.

Step 2: Implement Operator-only mode
Build /operator-console page showing all active alerts ‚Üí generates list of airline/meta URLs.

You keep that page open, clicking through results ‚Üí extension ingests ‚Üí backend matches ‚Üí users get alerts.

Step 3: Add alerts system
Create alerts table.

Add /alerts CRUD.

Add match logic in /api/ingest.

Step 4: Add Price War + Adventurous
Create price_history table.

Ingest pipeline logs every fare to history.

Price War = alert when new fare < median by X%.

Adventurous = origin-only + budget + date flexibility.
