Overview
This PR significantly enhances the Flight Alert App by transforming it from a basic flight search API into a comprehensive flight search and price alert system. All enhancements are implemented in main.py as requested, maintaining 100% backward compatibility while adding powerful new features.

Key Features Added
üöÄ Advanced Flight Search
The /api/query endpoint now supports sophisticated filtering options:

Price Range Filtering: Use min_price and max_price for precise budget control
Airline Preference: Filter by airline with partial name matching (e.g., "american", "united")
Duration Filtering: Set max_duration in minutes to find shorter flights
Enhanced Flight Data: Each flight now includes aircraft type, formatted duration, and price-per-hour calculations
üì¢ Price Alert System
Implemented a complete price alert system:

Alert Thresholds: Set alert_price to get notified when flights drop below your target price
Alert Tracking: View all triggered alerts via the new /api/alerts endpoint
Smart Statistics: Get comprehensive price analytics including average, min, and max prices for routes
üõ£Ô∏è Route Analytics
New /api/routes endpoint provides:

Complete overview of available flight routes
Price ranges for each route
Airlines serving each route
Flight availability statistics
üìä Enhanced Data & Documentation
Expanded Dataset: Increased from 3 to 10 flights across 6 major routes (JFK‚ÜîLAX, LAX‚ÜîORD, ORD‚ÜîJFK, LAX‚ÜíDEN, JFK‚ÜíBOS, LAX‚ÜíSEA)
Rich Documentation: Comprehensive API documentation at the root endpoint with examples and parameter descriptions
Better Responses: Flights sorted by price, human-readable durations, and enhanced error messages
Example Usage
Basic Search (Backward Compatible)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"departure": "JFK", "arrival": "LAX"}'

    "arrival": "LAX", 
    "max_price": 300, 
    "alert_price": 280, 
    "airline": "american",
    "max_duration": 400
  }'
View Available Routes

Technical Improvements
Enhanced Error Handling: Added 500 error handler and improved error messages with helpful tips
Advanced Validation: Price range validation and parameter consistency checks
Better Logging: Detailed startup information and request/response logging
Code Organization: Added helper functions for duration formatting and enhanced code structure
