Perfect — thanks for pasting the full logs, they tell the whole story. Let’s break it down clearly.

🔎 What’s Happening Right Now
✅ Backend boots fine

DB initialized, Playwright validation ready, BYOB mode running.

GET /api/airports works (you can search “lhr” → results come back).

POST /api/query works (Query 1 created: LHR → AMS).

🔄 Frontend polls for results

Every second it calls /api/results/1.

Logs show:

⏳ Query 1: No results yet (DB has 0 total for this query)
This means your database never received any fares.

❌ Extension never ingested fares

The missing piece: your Chrome extension is supposed to scrape (or stub) fares and POST them to /api/ingest.

That post never happens → DB empty → frontend loops forever.

🚨 Why It’s Not Working
Extension is installed (you saw “FlightAlert BYOB Bridge” in Extensions), but:

It isn’t actually injecting content.js into flight sites (wrong manifest.json host permissions).

Or content.js loads but has no code to scrape/post results to backend.

Or it tries to post but hits a CORS/network error.

👉 The backend is working. The frontend is working. Only the extension → ingestion link is missing.

🛠 How to Confirm
Open Chrome DevTools on Skyscanner / Expedia / EasyJet page after clicking the links from your dashboard:

Look for console logs like:

[BYOB] Content script loaded: https://www.skyscanner.net/...
[BYOB] Extracted fares: [...]
[BYOB] Posted to backend: {ok: true, count: 3}
If you see nothing → content script not injected.

If you see [BYOB] Extracted fares but then Error posting → network/CORS issue.

✅ How to Fix
1. Fix manifest.json
Make sure it has correct matches:

{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "FlightAlert BYOB Bridge",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "permissions": ["scripting", "activeTab"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "*://*.skyscanner.net/*",
    "*://*.expedia.*/*",
    "*://*.easyjet.com/*",
    "*://*.kayak.*/*",
    "*://*.ryanair.com/*",
    "*://*.ba.com/*"
  ],
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": [
        "*://*.skyscanner.net/*",
        "*://*.expedia.*/*",
        "*://*.easyjet.com/*",
        "*://*.kayak.*/*",
        "*://*.ryanair.com/*",
        "*://*.ba.com/*"
      ],
      "js": ["content.js"]
    }
  ]
}
2. Add Logging + Dummy Ingestion in content.js
Paste this inside content.js:

console.log("[BYOB] Content script loaded on:", window.location.href);

// Fake scraped fares (to prove end-to-end works)
const fakeFares = [
  {
    origin: "LHR",
    destination: "AMS",
    date: "2025-09-06",
    airline: "easyJet",
    price: Math.floor(Math.random() * 200) + 50
  }
];

console.log("[BYOB] Extracted fares:", fakeFares);

// Post to backend
fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/ingest", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query_id: 1, fares: fakeFares })
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log("[BYOB] Posted to backend:", data))
  .catch(err => console.error("[BYOB] Error posting fares:", err));
3. Add /api/ingest in Backend
In main.py:

@app.post("/api/ingest")
def ingest(payload: dict):
    query_id = payload.get("query_id")
    fares = payload.get("fares", [])
    logging.info(f"📩 Received {len(fares)} fares for query {query_id}")
    for fare in fares:
        save_to_db(query_id, fare)
        logging.debug(f"💾 Stored fare: {fare}")
    return {"ok": True, "count": len(fares)}
4. Test the Flow
Start backend.

Open dashboard → create a query.

Click “Skyscanner” link → open in new tab.

In Chrome DevTools console, you should see [BYOB] Extracted fares.

Backend log should show:

📩 Received 1 fares for query 1
💾 Stored fare: {...}
Dashboard should update:

✅ Found 1 fares!
Success: 20%
🚀 Improvements
Debug Mode: Add console.log at every extension step.

CORS Headers: Make sure FastAPI allows requests from chrome-extension://*.

Stub First, Scrape Later: Prove ingestion works with dummy fares before writing real scrapers.

UI Feedback: Show “⚠️ No fares received from extension yet. Did you open the flight site?”

👉 Right now the system is looping forever because ingestion is missing. Fixing manifest.json + adding dummy ingestion will make it work end-to-end. Then you can swap the dummy fares for real scraped ones.
