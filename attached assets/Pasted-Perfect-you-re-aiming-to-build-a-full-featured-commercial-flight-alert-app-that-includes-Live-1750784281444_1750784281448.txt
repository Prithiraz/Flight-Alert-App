Perfect — you're aiming to build a full-featured commercial flight alert app that includes:

🛬 Live flight tracking (location, ETA)

💰 Price drop alerts

⚠️ Delay/cancellation alerts

🪑 Seat availability

🌍 Cheapest route alerts

And you want to do all of this with a budget of $0–7.50/month, ideally free.

✅ Here’s the Plan — All Features, Free or <$7.50
Feature	Data Source / Method	Free?	Cost	Notes
1. Live Flight Tracking	OpenSky Network API	✅	$0	Live ADS-B positions (limited region + 5s delay); no ETA info
ADS-B Exchange via RapidAPI	✅	$0	150 requests/day on free tier; global
AviationStack – free tier	✅	$0	100 API calls/month, includes ETA + status (not live location)
Combine OpenSky for location + AviationStack for status	✅	$0	Fully free but rate-limited
Optional: AviationStack Basic Plan	⚠️	$7.49/mo	10,000 API calls/month

| 2. Price Drop Alerts | Scrape airline or OTA (e.g. Kayak, EasyJet, Ryanair, Google Flights) using BeautifulSoup | ✅ | $0 | Requires scraping or headless browsing (can use cron + SQLite) |

| | Use headless browser only if necessary (e.g. Playwright/puppeteer with proxy) | ✅ | $0 | Works best on self-hosted VPS, not ideal for Replit long-term |
