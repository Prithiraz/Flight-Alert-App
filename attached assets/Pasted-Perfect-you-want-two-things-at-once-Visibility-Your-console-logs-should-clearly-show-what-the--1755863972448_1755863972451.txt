Perfect — you want two things at once:

Visibility → Your console/logs should clearly show what the app is doing in real time, not just “200 OK” spam.

Improvement → Actually make the app flow work so live flight prices get ingested, instead of being a shell.

Let’s go step by step.

🔎 1. Why Your Console Looks “Dead”
Right now your log is basically:

📝 Created query 8: LHR → AMS on 2025-09-04
INFO: "GET /api/results/8 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO: "GET /api/results/8 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO: "GET /api/results/8 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
That means:

Frontend is polling GET /api/results/{id} repeatedly.

Backend always returns the same empty result because no ingestion ever happened.

Logs don’t say “No results found yet” or “Awaiting BYOB ingestion” — so you think it’s doing nothing.

👉 Fix: Add explicit logging at every important step so you see what’s happening, even when there’s no data.

🔧 2. Add Proper Logs in Backend (main.py)
Inside your results route:

@app.get("/api/results/{query_id}")
def get_results(query_id: int):
    results = db_get_results(query_id)
    if not results:
        logging.info(f"⏳ No results yet for query {query_id}, still waiting for ingestion...")
    else:
        logging.info(f"✅ Returning {len(results)} fares for query {query_id}")
    return results
Inside your ingestion route:

@app.post("/api/ingest")
def ingest_fares(payload: dict):
    query_id = payload.get("query_id")
    fares = payload.get("fares", [])
    logging.info(f"📩 Received {len(fares)} fares from BYOB extension for query {query_id}")
    for fare in fares:
        save_to_db(query_id, fare)
        logging.debug(f"💾 Stored fare: {fare}")
    return {"ok": True, "count": len(fares)}
Now when your extension posts fares, console will show:

📩 Received 25 fares from BYOB extension for query 8
💾 Stored fare: LHR → AMS £92 EasyJet 2025-09-04
✅ Returning 25 fares for query 8
Instead of dead silence.

🔧 3. Fix Your BYOB Extension (So It Actually Posts Data)
In your content.js (the script injected into airline/OTA pages), add logging:

console.log("[BYOB] Content script loaded on", window.location.href);

// Example: pretend we scraped one fare
let extractedFares = [{
  origin: "LHR",
  destination: "AMS",
  date: "2025-09-04",
  airline: "EasyJet",
  price: 92
}];

// Send to backend
fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/ingest", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query_id: 8, // you’ll need to dynamically set this
    fares: extractedFares
  })
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log("[BYOB] Posted fares:", data))
  .catch(err => console.error("[BYOB] Error posting fares:", err));
So if you open DevTools Console on Expedia/EasyJet/Skyscanner, you should see:

[BYOB] Content script loaded on https://www.easyjet.com/...
[BYOB] Posted fares: {ok: true, count: 25}
👉 That’s your proof the extension is alive and communicating.

🔧 4. Fix Deep Links (So Pages Open to Results, Not Homepage)
Right now you probably generate wrong URLs. Use correct templates:

DEEP_LINKS = {
    "skyscanner": "https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights/{origin}/{dest}/{date}/",
    "googleflights": "https://www.google.com/flights?hl=en#flt={origin}.{dest}.{date}",
    "expedia": "https://www.expedia.com/Flights-Search?trip=oneway&leg1=from:{origin},to:{dest},departure:{date}TANYT&passengers=adults:1&options=cabinclass:economy"
}
Usage:

url = DEEP_LINKS["skyscanner"].format(origin="LHR", dest="AMS", date="250904")
✅ This ensures users actually land on results pages (so the extension can scrape), not on homepages.

🔧 5. Add Real-Time Feedback to Users
Right now users see nothing while waiting. Add “waiting” messages in frontend.

In dashboard.html JavaScript:

function pollResults(queryId) {
  fetch(`/api/results/${queryId}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      if (data.length === 0) {
        console.log("⏳ Still waiting for fares...");
        document.getElementById("status").innerText = "Waiting for results...";
      } else {
        console.log("✅ Got fares:", data);
        renderFares(data);
        document.getElementById("status").innerText = `Found ${data.length} fares!`;
      }
    })
    .catch(err => console.error("Error polling results:", err));
}
So users will see a live status instead of blank page.

📈 6. Improvements Beyond Logging
Background jobs: Add a scheduler (apscheduler) to periodically refresh queries, not just rely on extension hits.

Better storage: Normalize fare data (airline, cabin, price, time) in DB, so you can sort/filter later.

Multi-user BYOB: Right now only your browser collects fares. If you want “other users see results but don’t scrape themselves”, then your DB must act as central aggregator. Users query → your DB returns what your extension ingested earlier.

That means your console should also log user-facing events:

👤 User prithirazchoudhury2@gmail.com requested results for LHR → AMS
🔎 Returning cached fares from ingestion
🚀 After These Fixes
Console will be super chatty:

When users query.

When extension posts data.

When results are empty vs filled.

Users won’t see “dead air” anymore, they’ll see status updates like “waiting for fares…”.

Extension will actually bridge → backend → frontend, instead of your app being a “shell”.

Deep links will load airline results pages instead of dumping you to homepages.

✅ In short:
Right now your app is working skeleton only. The missing piece is extension → backend posting and clear logging.
Once you fix those, your console will show activity, your users will see results, and the app will feel alive.
