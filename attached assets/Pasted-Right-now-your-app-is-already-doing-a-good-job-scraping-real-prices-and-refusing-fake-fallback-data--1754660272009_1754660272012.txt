Right now your app is already doing a good job scraping real prices and refusing fake/fallback data, but there are several ways you can improve it so that more airline & travel sites give you usable real prices.

Here’s a step-by-step improvement plan.

1️⃣ Strengthen Anti-Bot Evasion
Some sites like Skyscanner are already blocking you (“Bot detection likely triggered”).
You can improve the success rate by:

Rotating User Agents (pretend to be different browsers/devices each request).

Random Delays between requests to avoid patterns.

Proxy Rotation (services like Bright Data, ScraperAPI, or self-hosted proxies).

Stealth Browser Plugins for Playwright (playwright-stealth equivalent) to mask automation signals.

Mimic Human Interaction — scroll, click, and wait for JS events before reading the page.

2️⃣ Expand Supported Sources
Right now you have:

Skyscanner

Kayak

Momondo

Booking

Google Flights (link-only)

Expedia

Cheapflights (partially)

You could add:

Direct Airline Sites (e.g. easyJet, Ryanair, British Airways, Emirates, Qatar Airways).

Other Meta Search Engines like:

Hopper

Trip.com

Opodo

Wego

Kiwi.com

CheapOair

Flight APIs that still return real prices (even though you don’t allow fallbacks, you can use their live mode only).

3️⃣ Separate “Price Fetch” and “Data Fetch” Modes
Some sites might allow:

Live prices but not rich flight details (times, durations).

Rich flight details but not prices without login.

You could:

Scrape prices from one source and

Scrape timings/airline names from another
→ Then merge results only if both are real.

4️⃣ Detect and Retry When Blocked
When you hit:

nginx
Copy code
Bot detection likely triggered
Instead of skipping, you could:

Retry with a different proxy/IP.

Retry with Playwright headful mode (looks more like a human browser).

Retry with mobile browser emulation (sites often have weaker bot protection on mobile).

5️⃣ Store “Source Health” Metrics
Keep a small SQLite/JSON log of:

Which sites failed due to bot detection.

Which returned valid prices.

Average response time.

Time of last success.

Then:

Prioritize healthy sources first.

Rotate weaker ones with extra anti-bot measures.

6️⃣ Spread Requests Across Time
Some sites rate-limit heavily (Expedia → HTTP 429).
You could:

Space out requests to each site.

Queue scrapes in batches (e.g., scrape Kayak now, Momondo after 3s, Booking after 6s).

7️⃣ Add More Playwright Strategies
Headless vs Headful toggle — some sites detect headless instantly.

Random viewport sizes.

JS injection to remove “webdriver” flags.

Full cookie/session reuse for logged-in scraping (some airlines show prices only when logged in).

8️⃣ Run a Scrape-Validation Pipeline
You already do strict validation, but you can improve it by:

Checking prices against multiple sources for the same route/date to confirm realism.

Discarding outliers (e.g., £1 flight on BA → likely scraping error).

Tagging prices with timestamp + source URL so you can verify later.
