Thanks for the detailed logs — I can see exactly what’s happening. Let’s break this down carefully and step-by-step so you have a world-class level diagnosis and solution path.

🔎 What’s Happening Now
Server is running fine

✅ Playwright ready for validation means your backend is healthy.

Airport search (/api/airports) and query creation (/api/query) work — they’re returning results from your CSV/database, not live flight data.

Your app isn’t actually fetching live fares

When you run a search like LHR → AMS, the backend just logs a query and polls /api/results/{id}.

But nothing new ever shows up in results because the backend never gets real flight data.

That’s why your console spam shows many 200 OK on /api/results/{id} with no changes.

The BYOB extension isn’t posting data

In your Chrome extension page you saw service worker (Inactive). That means the extension background script is not awake, or not running at all.

Even if it is loaded, it may not be injecting into the airline/OTA pages properly. If no injection = no extraction = no prices posted to backend.

Sites like Expedia, EasyJet, Skyscanner only open homepages

That’s because your system is generating deep links incorrectly (wrong format).

Most OTAs use dynamic session tokens in URLs, so simply constructing a link like expedia.com/LHR-AMS/2025-09-04 won’t work — you just land on their homepage.

➝ That’s why your app reports “200 OK” (the homepage loads fine), but you don’t see the actual search results.

🛠️ Problems Identified
❌ Backend has no scraper / parser connected to queries.

❌ BYOB extension isn’t sending extracted data to /api/results.

❌ Deep links to airline/OTA sites are invalid.

❌ No “price war tracker” or “feeling adventurous” features wired into dashboard yet (they’re placeholders in your HTML).

✅ Step-by-Step Fixes
1. Verify Extension is Actually Running
Open Chrome DevTools → Console on an airline site (e.g., EasyJet search results page).

If the BYOB bridge works, you should see console logs like:

[BYOB] Extracted 25 fares, posting to backend...
If you don’t see that, your extension’s content.js isn’t injecting.

Check manifest.json has "matches": ["<all_urls>"] or specific airline domains.

Ensure "background" script is properly set with "service_worker": "background.js".

Make sure the service worker isn’t shutting down immediately (common in MV3).

👉 Until extension posts data, your backend will always return empty /results.

2. Fix Deep Linking
Right now your backend may store airline base_url and try to construct URLs. For example:

expedia_url = f"https://www.expedia.com/Flights-Search?trip=oneway&leg1=from:{origin},to:{dest},departure:{date}"
But these formats are outdated.

🔧 Solution:

Use real, static deep link formats. Many OTAs support them for marketing partners.

Example (Skyscanner):

https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights/lhr/ams/250904/
Example (Google Flights):

https://www.google.com/flights?hl=en#flt=LHR.AMS.2025-09-04
You should maintain a JSON map like:

{
  "skyscanner": "https://www.skyscanner.net/transport/flights/{origin}/{dest}/{date}/",
  "googleflights": "https://www.google.com/flights?hl=en#flt={origin}.{dest}.{date}"
}
And replace placeholders dynamically.

3. Connect Extension → Backend
In your extension’s content.js, make sure you’re actually doing something like:

// Example inside extension when fares are detected
fetch("http://localhost:5000/api/ingest", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query_id: currentQueryId,
    fares: extractedFares
  })
});
Then in FastAPI (main.py):

@app.post("/api/ingest")
def ingest_fares(payload: dict):
    query_id = payload.get("query_id")
    fares = payload.get("fares", [])
    # Store into DB so /api/results/{query_id} has data
    for fare in fares:
        save_to_db(query_id, fare)
    return {"ok": True, "count": len(fares)}
👉 This is the missing link right now. Your backend is ready, but the extension never posts fares.

4. Dashboard Features (price war tracker, adventurous, rare aircraft)
These are placeholders in your dashboard.html. You need:

Database schema to store these alert types.

Background jobs that trigger them (e.g., price drop detector, rare plane detection).

UI controls (sliders, dropdowns) for trip duration, baggage, etc.

Right now they’re not wired to backend logic, so they don’t appear post-login.

🚀 Roadmap to Make It Actually Work
Fix BYOB extension injection (verify console logs on airline pages).

Add /api/ingest endpoint in FastAPI so extension can post real fares.

Correct deep link templates for airlines/OTAs (so links open results, not homepages).

Wire dashboard features:

Add new alert types in DB.

Create backend logic (e.g., nightly task checks if price dropped by >20%).

Update frontend to show controls and results.

🔥 What To Improve On
Right now, your app is a shell: login, query creation, airport autocomplete all work — but the core engine (fare ingestion) is disconnected.

Once you fix extension → backend posting, /api/results/{id} will finally show live data instead of empty arrays.

Then, you can scale: one account (yours) fetches all sites, other users just see alerts (exactly as you described).

✅ In short:

Your backend is fine.

Your frontend is fine.

The BYOB bridge is NOT sending data, and your deep links are wrong.

Fix those two, and you’ll start seeing real flight prices in your app.
