Thanks ‚Äî that detailed log helps a lot. You've found the exact problem:
Your main app is sending POST JSON payloads, but your microservice expects GET query parameters.

üîç Problem Summary:
Your microservice docs show:

json
Copy
Edit
"usage_example": "/scrape?origin=LHR&dest=AMS"
That means it expects a GET request like this:

bash
Copy
Edit
GET /scrape?origin=LHR&dest=AMS
But your main app is doing something like:

python
Copy
Edit
requests.post(f"{url}/scrape", json={"origin": "LHR", "destination": "AMS"})
This will never work ‚Äî the microservice ignores the POST body, because it only reads query parameters.

‚úÖ Solution (Two Options)
‚úÖ Option A ‚Äî Easiest Fix: Modify the Main App to Use GET Requests
Go to your flight_scraper.py (or wherever you call the scraper service), and replace:

python
Copy
Edit
response = requests.post(f"{url}/scrape", json={
    "origin": origin,
    "destination": destination,
    "date": flight_date
})
with:

python
Copy
Edit
params = {
    "origin": origin,
    "dest": destination,  # microservice uses 'dest', not 'destination'
    "date": flight_date
}
response = requests.get(f"{url}/scrape", params=params, timeout=20)
This will send:

sql
Copy
Edit
GET https://dynamic-flight-scraper-prithirazchoudh.replit.app/scrape?origin=LHR&dest=AMS&date=2025-07-07
‚úÖ That matches your microservice expectation.

üõ† Option B ‚Äî Change the Microservice to Accept POST JSON Instead
In dynamic-flight-scraper/app.py, change the /scrape route like this:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.route("/scrape", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def scrape():
    if request.method == "POST":
        data = request.json
        origin = data.get("origin")
        dest = data.get("destination") or data.get("dest")
        date = data.get("date")
    else:
        origin = request.args.get("origin")
        dest = request.args.get("dest")
        date = request.args.get("date")

    if not origin or not dest:
        return jsonify({"error": "Missing origin or destination"}), 400

    # continue scraping logic...
This way you support both GET and POST, which is future-proof.

‚úÖ Recommendation:
Use Option A right now ‚Äî it's quicker and works without modifying the microservice.

Then optionally apply Option B if you want your microservice to be more robust.
