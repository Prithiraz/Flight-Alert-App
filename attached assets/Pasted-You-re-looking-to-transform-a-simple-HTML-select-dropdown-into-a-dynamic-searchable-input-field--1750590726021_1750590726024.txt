You're looking to transform a simple HTML <select> dropdown into a dynamic, searchable input field, especially with a large dataset like 9096 airports. This can't be done with pure HTML and Jinja2 alone. You'll need to incorporate JavaScript (specifically a library or plugin) to achieve this interactive functionality on the client-side.

Here's a breakdown of what you need to do and the general steps:

Core Concept:

Replace the <select> with a text input: The user will type into this.
Use JavaScript to listen for user input: As the user types, send a request (often using AJAX) to your server.
Server-side filtering: Your server receives the search term, filters the 9096 airports based on it, and sends back a much smaller, relevant list.
JavaScript displays results: The client-side JavaScript takes this filtered list and displays it to the user (e.g., in a dropdown list that appears below the input field).
Handle selection: When the user selects an airport from the displayed results, populate a hidden input field with the airport's code, or directly update the visible input with the airport's display name.
Recommended Approach: Using a JavaScript Library (e.g., Select2, Chosen, or a custom autocomplete)

The easiest and most robust way to do this is to use a pre-built JavaScript library.

Option 1: Select2 (Highly Recommended)
Select2 is a popular and powerful library that transforms standard HTML selects into searchable components.

Steps to Implement with Select2:

1. Include jQuery and Select2 Libraries:

You'll need jQuery (Select2 depends on it) and the Select2 CSS and JavaScript files. Add these to your HTML <head> section or at the end of your <body> before your own scripts.

HTML

<head>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/select2@4.1.0-rc.0/dist/css/select2.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
<body>
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-/JqT3SQfawRcv/BIHPThkBvs0OEvtFFmqPF/lYI/Cxo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/select2@4.1.0-rc.0/dist/js/select2.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            // Initialize Select2 on your airport select elements
            $('.select2-airport').select2({
                placeholder: 'Search for an airport',
                allowClear: true,
                minimumInputLength: 2, // Don't search until user types at least 2 characters
                ajax: {
                    url: '/search-airports', // This will be your backend endpoint
                    dataType: 'json',
                    delay: 250, // Delay in milliseconds before sending the request
                    data: function (params) {
                        return {
                            q: params.term // search term
                        };
                    },
                    processResults: function (data) {
                        return {
                            results: data.airports.map(function(airport) {
                                return {
                                    id: airport.code,
                                    text: airport.display_name // Or airport.code + ' - ' + airport.display_name
                                };
                            })
                        };
                    },
                    cache: true
                }
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
2. Modify Your HTML (Slightly):

Keep your existing <select> tags, but add a class like select2-airport to them. Select2 will then transform these.

HTML

    <div class="form-group">
        <label>Departure Airport:</label>
        <select name="departure_airport" class="select2-airport" style="width: 100%;">
            <option value="">Any Airport</option>
            </select>
    </div>
    <div class="form-group">
        <label>Destination Airport:</label>
        <select name="destination_airport" class="select2-airport" style="width: 100%;">
            <option value="">Any Airport</option>
            </select>
    </div>
    ```
**Important:** The `style="width: 100%;"` helps Select2 render correctly.

**3. Create a Backend Endpoint (e.g., in Flask/Python):**

You need a new route in your Flask (or Django, Node.js, etc.) application that handles the `GET /search-airports` request. This endpoint will receive the `q` parameter (the user's search term) and return a JSON list of matching airports.

```python
# In your Flask app.py (example)
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# This would ideally come from a database or a large data file
# For demonstration, let's create a mock airport list
all_airports = [
    {"code": "LHR", "display_name": "London Heathrow"},
    {"code": "JFK", "display_name": "New York JFK"},
    {"code": "LAX", "display_name": "Los Angeles International Airport"},
    {"code": "CDG", "display_name": "Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport"},
    {"code": "DXB", "display_name": "Dubai International Airport"},
    {"code": "NRT", "display_name": "Narita International Airport"},
    {"code": "AMS", "display_name": "Amsterdam Schiphol Airport"},
    {"code": "FRA", "display_name": "Frankfurt Airport"},
    {"code": "SIN", "display_name": "Singapore Changi Airport"},
    {"code": "SYD", "display_name": "Sydney Airport"},
    # ... imagine 9000 more airports here
]

@app.route('/')
def index():
    # You might still pass some initial data for other parts of the form
    return render_template('your_template_name.html', airlines=["British Airways", "Emirates"])

@app.route('/search-airports')
def search_airports():
    search_term = request.args.get('q', '').lower()
    filtered_airports = [
        airport for airport in all_airports
        if search_term in airport['display_name'].lower() or search_term in airport['code'].lower()
    ]
    # Limit results for performance/usability
    return jsonify(airports=filtered_airports[:20]) # Send top 20 matches

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
Why Select2 is good for 9096 airports:

AJAX Support: It's built to load data asynchronously, so you don't load all 9096 airports into the browser at once.
Performance: It handles large datasets efficiently by only displaying relevant results.
User Experience: Provides a familiar search-as-you-type interface.
